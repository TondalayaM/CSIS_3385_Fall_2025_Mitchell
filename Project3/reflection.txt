Reflection

This project reminded me of the old myspace and geocities days because I had to do alot of research looking up codes for different colors and trying to make everything fit properly on the page. I never thought that it would be somewhat beneificial to me in the future. The most important changes was making sure I use <fieldset> ,<legend> and placeholders.This made everything a lot cleaner, organized and helped me understand the different groups because it was easier to read. Another important change , which is also an addressed security issue was changing the method from DELETE to POST . I honestly kept forgetting this major step, which is why my code wasn't working for 2 days. I also added "<required>". This change makes sure that all fields are completed. I also learned that the method can never be DELETE because the browser doesn't understand it.  The only acceptable method would be GET or POST for HTML. If this was live production, I would research more security codes to make sure that the form is fully safe like making sure its protected from bots by using CAPTACHA or email verification. After doing futher research,I could have also turned on HTTPS.
